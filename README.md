# Shuvi.js Project

This is a [Shuvi.js](https://shuvijs.github.io/shuvijs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-shuvi`](https://github.com/shuvijs/shuvi/tree/main/packages/create-shuvi).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/routes/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://shuvijs.github.io/shuvijs.org/docs/guide/Routes#api-routes) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api](http://localhost:3000/api). This endpoint can be edited in `src/routes/api/api.ts`.

The `src/routes/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://shuvijs.github.io/shuvijs.org/docs/guide/Routes#api-routes) instead of React pages.
